# Air-Hockey

*also known as Pong-Hockey, based on the original Pong-game design*

---

**Air-Hockey** aka Pong-Hockey
is a game development project aimed at learning the basics of Game Development and navigating Unity's Game Engine. The game itself will simulate a game of Air Hockey where 1-2 players are able to play. In its first iterations, we will recreate regular pong. Once we've reached the pong stage, we will then develop it further into its final stage, Air Hockey or Pong-Hockey.
