# Air-Hockey (Work In Progress)

*also known as Pong-Hockey, based on the original Pong-game design*

---

**Air-Hockey** aka Pong-Hockey
A game that simulates 7 rounds of 2D Air-Hockey. In its first official build iterations, we will recreate regular pong. Once we've completed the pong stage, we will then develop and transform it into its final stage, Air Hockey.

## About
This Unity project is a Work In Progress (WIP), founded by Peter Uriarte, Maria Trezha Von Bargen, and Julia Mitchell and will serve as project leads for this project. The goal of this project aimed at learning the basics of Game Development, navigating Unity's Game Engine, develop proficiency in C#, and working under team collaboration on GitHub. This project is beginner friendly and should cover the basics of scripting, game objects/prefabs, basic collisions, and more.

## Project Plans and Goals

- Recreate Pong in Unity. (Paddle and Ball physics/interactions, Score System, Good Game Feeling)
- Develop Pong into Air Hockey. (Hockey Paddle with expanded freedom of movement, Ball physics update, smaller goal hitboxes, Visual Overhaul to match Air Hockey Aesthetic)
- Add a basic functional UI system (Main Menu, Pause Screen, Settings).
- Add Music and Sound Effects.
- Possibly add a cheat codes for silly modes. hehe.
