# Air-Hockey (Work In Progress)

*also known as Pong-Hockey, based on the original Pong-game design*

---

A game that simulates 7 rounds of 2D Air-Hockey. In its first official build iterations, we will recreate regular pong. Once we've completed the pong stage, we will then develop and transform it into its final stage, Air Hockey.
